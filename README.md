  In this project , we have developed an android application which takes the images of handwritten text as input and convert it into an editable text
  document.
  It is based on neural networks efficiently and accurately  recognizes characters. In addition to recognizing handwriting, it effectively handles 
  formatting, accurately segment characters, and determine the most likely words.
